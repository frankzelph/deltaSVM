# deltaSVM

Based on HT-SELEX data from [Yin et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28473536), we trained [deltaSVM](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3331) models for 533 distinc tanscriptio factors(TFs). We then evaluated performance of 129 out of 533 models using SNP-SELEX data and selected 94 models with high accuracy (AUPRC>0.75) for genome-wide prediction.
